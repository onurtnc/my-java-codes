## Java Projects (Fundamental & Intermediate)

This section contains my Java projects developed to strengthen my understanding
of core programming concepts and object-oriented design.

### Covered Topics
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation
- Control Flow (loops, conditions)
- Collections (ArrayList, HashMap)
- File I/O basics
- Basic exception handling
- Console-based application logic

### Project Types
- Console-based applications
- Small simulations (e.g., ATM, student management, game logic)
- Practice projects focused on clean code and logical flow

### Purpose
These projects demonstrate my ability to:
- Translate problem statements into working Java code
- Apply OOP principles correctly
- Build maintainable and readable programs
- Strengthen my programming fundamentals alongside cybersecurity studies

> Note: While my primary focus is cybersecurity and SOC-related work,
a solid programming foundation in Java helps me better understand
automation, secure coding principles, and software behavior.
